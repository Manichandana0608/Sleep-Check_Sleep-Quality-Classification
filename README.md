# Sleep Check-Sleep Quality Classification
# Developed "Sleep Check," a Sleep Quality Classification system.

# Data Collection and Exploration

 Collected a data or dataset for our Sleep Quality Classification and performed Exploratory Data Analysis.

# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engeeneering

In this we have dealed with missing values, encoding variables and done feature scaling and dropped irrelevant attributes.

# Model Selection and Training

In this we have performed splitting of data into train and test and applied required algorithms.

# Model Evaluation

In this we have made predictions and  calculated the metrics like accuracy, precision,recall and f1-score etc. And we analysed the predictions.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

We have defined the hyperparameter Space, set up cross validation performed grid search and analysed the results.

# Model Comparision

We have plotted graphs for the evaluation metrics which we have calculated and analysed the results and found the which algorithm or model is suitable or gives more accuracy before and after performing hyperparameter tuning.

# Sleep pattern Analysis

In this we have performed EDA, Time series analysis, pattern analysis and interpretation and also we performed corralation analysis and pattern identification.

# Visualising and Reporting

We have performed visualisation of Predicted vs actual sleep Quality, Visualized Individual Sleep Quality, Created Aggregate Sleep Quality Visualization ,Reporting and Dashboard Development,Visualized Individual Sleep Quality and  Compared Predicted and Actual Sleep Quality.
